<h3>Discussion with Classmate:</h3>
<p>
The classmate I talked to preferred FiberTalk, but I googled it and it was already taken by a podcast/website. They were worried about the connotation of moths, but within the context of using a lot of fiber to create crafts they can see the appeal. "Itch-to-stitch" seems like a pain to type out was her opinion of the third one.

	<h3>Domain Name:</h3>
	<p>
I decided on cloth moth as the younger generation thinks moths are cute. As I'm trying to renew interest in fiber arts beyond knitting and crocheting, this is my primary audience. It's also great because fiber artists consume lots of fiber to make their art.
