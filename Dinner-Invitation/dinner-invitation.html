<h1>Guests of Honor:</h1>

<br>

<h2>Niccolo Macchiavelli:</h2>
<img src ="Dinner-invitation/macchiavelli.jpg" width="400" height="500">
<p>Niccolo Machiavelli was a politician from Italy whose influence and machinations won over lots of people. Then it became
    his downfall as he was unreliable and considered too powerful and disloyal to have as a long-term ally. He ended up penning
    the famous book on political treatise, "The Prince." Eventually, that piece of writing ended up coining the term 
    "Machiavellian." He's an objectively morally bankrupt person, but I think it would be interest to debate ethics and
    morality with him.

<h2>Boudicca:</h2>
<img src ="Dinner-invitation/boudicca.jpg" width="400" height="500">
<p>Queen consort of Norfolk during the era where the Roman empire was invading Britain. The Romans claimed that they would
respect the kingdom's independence and then came back with an army and pillaged her town, including hurting her two
daughters. She waged open war against the Romans and was one of the first people to make the argument that wealth and
government security wasn't worth independence and freedom of both individuals and culture. I would love to talk with her
because I admire her ethics personally.

<h2>Plutarch:</h2>
<img src ="Dinner-invitation/plutarch.jpg" width="400" height="500">
<p>He was an ancient greek philosopher who worked as the high priest of Apollo at the temple of Delphi. Many of the temple's
    secrets were taken to the grave as it was considered common cultural knowledge that would never be erased. He wrote down
    some of his findings, but not all of them. I'd be interested in talking philosophy with him especially as many Greek
    philosophers regularly rejected the idea of being ruled over by any gods solely based on authority.
