	<h1>White Hat: Information</h1>
	<p>There is a lack of information on spinning websites and tutorials. No facts and figures for it. But we do know it's for intermediate spinners and that the website is going to focus on art yarn specifically. Ideally, we should know the demand for this so that we know how strong the website needs to be for handling presence. We also need to know if we'll need translations available for international traffic. Potential subject matter experts that can guide the knowledge and the project forward would also help the project a lot. A YouTube channel that directs them to the website so they can learn more is also a good idea. Also, a good website name that is applicable and easy to remember. Some questions that were asked were: "What questions need to be asked," and "How strong should the server be," "What mechanisms should be housing the tutorial videos," and "How do we get this information?" Potentially having experts make classes for the website would help solidify a fanbase.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>Red Hat: Emotion</h2>
	<p>Subject feels excited because there is a need for this and that it will grow a community. She is also excited for how it will help other people. She thinks it will be a slow growth for the website, but that it has potential to reach a lot of spinners given time. There is a natural curiosity for spinning as a concept and classes for it would be interesting.</p>

	<br>

	<h3>Black Hat: Judgement</h3>
	<p>There doesn't seem to be anything that doesn't fit or is line with the vison. However, there is a lack of information on the demand and the infrastructure that we will use and need for this.
		Other potential problems include interpersonal conflicts, technological issues and funding are potential issues. Obtaining skilled subject matter experts will also be difficult.
		We could potentially lose money and waste time if it's not successful. Not to mention, large social media footprint that will land the creators unwanted attention.</p>

	<br>

	<h1>Yellow Hat: Optimism</h1>
	<p>Why might this work? It might work because there is a potential demand for it that hasn't been mapped out yet because the audience is underserved. The founder is also excited about the idea which creates a driving force.
		What value does this have? It would teach people skills that they don't have and need to polish. It would create a knowledge base for that and it creates a community.
		What could we do to make this work? We could be consistent in the approach, delivery, and setup. Also, being attentive to our audience's needs.
		What might make this more attractive to users? Knowing that the classes that are advertised are actually held and that engagement will be consistent. Subject matter experts that are present to answer questions will make it easier.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>Green Hat: Creativity</h2>
	<p>Potentially switching it from spinning to fiber arts in general as it also suffers from a loss of focus from subject matter experts. Spinning art yarn could also be a book all on its own rather than a website.
		What ideas do you have about this? It could also be used to sell yarn or various fibers. Or companies that sell looms and other fiber art supplies. Community college classes could also be offered for this. Presentations at libraries for children to help spread the interest.
		How can we fix the Black Hat problems? More research is necessary, specifically for local groups of fiber artists. Local groups and online forums can be used to obtain subject matter experts. Visiting conventions like FiberFest.</p>

	<br>

	<h3>Blue Hat: Management</h3>
	<p>What is the subject? The subject is creating and expanding a forum for fiber arts ethusiasists.
		What are we thinking about? The agenda is that we have to do the research for the audience and work on the infrastructure for ideas.
		What is our goal? The goal is to provide a place of knowledge and community for the fiber artist community.
		How do we keep our discussion on track? An online whiteboard with our agenda, specifically Notion. This is an online organizing and planning website.
		What conclusions do we have for each hat?</p>

	<h1>Project Improvements:</h1>
	<p>I had this discussion with my mother who started her own business and inherited a restaurant from my grandfather. She also has been involved with starting other people's businesses before, so I knew she would have innvaluable advice on this. Her advice inspired me to widen the range of the product, especially since I wasn't a subject matter expert on spinning yet. I decided it should be for fiber arts videos in general and that I would create a forum where people could talk about fiber arts in general as well as posting tutorial videos with citations, obviously.</p>
