<div class="Why">
	<h1>Why I chose these movies?</h1>
	<p>These are movies that I enjoyed as I got older. I was never much of a movie person growing up. I always preferred TV shows or books. But recently, I have become quite the cinephile and I've been fascinated by scripts with excellent writing or twists. I have discovered I have a particular fondness for sleuthing, which I uncovered as I developed my tastes in films.</p>

	<div class="Scream">
<img src="/asg12/images/Scream.jpg" class="Scream-image">
<h2>Scream(1996)</h2>
<p>A classic slasher film from the 90s that borders more on dark comedy than horror. The story is about Sidney, whose mother died under brutal circumstances, is now reliving the experience as a killer is hunting her. The movie is packed with meta-humor about horror movies and their tropes, but more importantly, I've never seen a killer get beat up so many times.</p>

	<br>

	<div class="Alien-Romulus">
<img src="/asg12/images/AlienRomulus.jpg" class="Alien-Romulus-image">

<p>A recent remake of the Alien series from the 1980s. A rebellious group of teens go into space hoping to get rich. What they find is the original spaceship from the original movie, still infested with aliens that devour their host and burst out of their chest. As well as the fully-grown aliens with acid blood and near invincibility, seeking only nourishment in the form of flesh.</p>

<br>

<div class="The-Batman">
	<img src="/asg12/images/TheBatman.jpg" class="The-Batman-image">
	<h2>The Batman</h2>
	<p>Robert Pattison plays the role of the dark knight in this movie and does a stellar portrayal of earlier versions of Batman. He stalks his prey, The Riddler, throughout this film as he attempts to prevent him from continuing his murdering spree. Meanwhile, he must quell Catwoman's lust for revenge. But how can he? Especially since he hasn't come to terms with his own desire for vengeance.</p>

<div class="Knives-Out">
<img src="/asg12/images/KnivesOut.jpg" class="Knives-Out-image">
<h2>Knives Out</h2>
<p>Wealthy entrepreneur, Harlan Thrombey, has died under mysterious circumstances. It is up to the winsome Cajun gentleman, Benoit Blanc, to solve it. He will discover the culprit by untangling the story Harlan's greedy and conniving family have cooked up for him. But it's never the person you expect with this screenwriter. It inspires laughter in an awkward sort of fashion, but it has its own unique charm.</p>

<div class="The-Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show">

<h2>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</h2>
<p>A freshly-engaged young couple get stranded in a rainstorm at an eccentric person's house. They'd like to leave, but they're forced to watch Dr. Frank create the most perfect man against their will. It's a musical with horror themes, but isn't quite horror per se. Just very inappropriate in general, but it's a good watch.</p>
