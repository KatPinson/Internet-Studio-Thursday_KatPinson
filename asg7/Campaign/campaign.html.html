    <h1>Catherine the Great</h1>
    <img src="/asg7/Campaign/images/catherine-the-great.jpg">
    <p>
The Empress of Russia that ruled in the 1700s that pushed the empire into greatness. She was one of the first nobles to open a house for abandoned children, created bureaucratic laws that included serfs, and established schools that taught different castes of society skilled labor. She spared no expense to bring world-reknowned geniuses at the time to Russia, and invested in many different intellectual organizations in many different countries.

    <p>
        I believe that in a time when academic institutions are losing their funding it is important to focus on the betterment of humanity all the same. She was a polymath that enjoyed many subjects and valued talent before money and power. She used her exorbitant amounts of wealth to speak truth to power.

        <h1>Margaery Tyrell</h1>
        <p>
            A masterclass manipulator in <i>Game of Thrones</i>. She had a heart of gold and a silver tongue that allowed her to stay in favor of any noble, peasant, or merchant. She's uses every aspect of her appearance and mannerisms, even her fashion sense, to uphold society's expectations while pushing the boundaries of what was allowed at the time. She would help keep Catherine's public image in good condition as Catherine received a lot of criticism from her foreign allies and adversaries alike.

    <h1>Campaign Platform:</h1>
    <p>
        The platform this campaign is based around is education. I think we focus too much on reaching goals in education rather than actually fostering a love for learning and benefitting society as a whole. We cut so much funding that life long learning comes secondary to making our scores look the best.
