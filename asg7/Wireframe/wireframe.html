<h1>Questions:</h1>
<p>
    The benefits of sketching a wireframe website would be that you could develop many different kinds of setups rather quickly. You could also collaborate on these sketches with others and compare and contrast before putting it into wireframe software. The software benefits you in the sense that you could present a more professional version to clients. Also if you're working by yourself and you only only have one idea of what you want it to look like, it would also be made easier through software.

    I will be making a medium fidelity website. I want there to be some interactivity and forms so that fiber artists might communicate. This rules out lo-fi. It needs to be simplistic so users can navigate the site easy while looking for what they need, so it won't be high fidelity.
