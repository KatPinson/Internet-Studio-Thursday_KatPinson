	<h1>Fiendish Schemes:</h1>
	<div class="enlisting-blood-war">
	<h2 class="blood-war-header">Enlisting in Avernus' Blood War</h2>
	<img src="/midterm/images/bloodwar.jpg" class="bloodwar">
	<p>The archdevil of Avernus, Zariel, is always looking for more recruits for the never-ending war against the Abyss in her volcanic hellscape. The river Styx runs through the hells, flooding Avernus with demon armies and lords. You'll be fighting against demons that can size from you-sized to gargantuan, that is if you're not crushed by Zariel's forces on accident. Now go be a part of the fodder that keeps the wheels turning in the hells!</p>

<div class="cania-library">
	<h2 class="cania-header">Working in Cania's Libraries</h2>
	<img src="/midterm/images/library.jpg" class="library">
	<p>
		The second most powerful being in the nine hells, Mephistopheles, rules over the icy-cold Cania. It's a veritable wealth of knowledge in the hells with its many frozen libraries. You're very lucky, you must have developed an aptitude for magic in your travels. Now you can spend all eternity in the cold with only your magic to keep you warm. Hopefully you don't catch Mephistopheles' eye, because his fiery wrath and cold demeanor might cut your stay short.

	<div class="maladomini-paperwork">
	<h2 class="maladomini-header">Pushing Paperwork in Maladomini</h2>
	<img src="/midterm/images/paperwork.jpg" class="paperwork">
	<p>
		One of the core tenets of the hells is bureuacracy and all of hells' paperwork is funneled through Baalzebul's ream of Maladomini. If there is even a single error in your paperwork, expect strict reprisals in the form of ration shortages or beatings. If you do a poor enough job, they'll transfer your soul into a soul coin and you'll uphold the bureaucracy one way or another.
