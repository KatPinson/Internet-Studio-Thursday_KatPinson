	<h1>Binding Contract Statement</h1>
	<p class="statement">I wanted to capture the fantastical yet dark feel of the Nine Hells from Dungeons & Dragons. My first steps were to consider what parts of the hells I would talk about and what would best represent them. Firstly, an indebted person who sold their soul to a devil would have to write the sentences. I wanted to lend the air that this outlandish and cruel behavior in the hells was both normal and at times merciful if it was painless and quick enough. Each devil embodies a facet of human ideals that were either perverted to their own twisted means or the most depraved parts of humanity that already exists that is inherently flawed. I love Dungeons & Dragons, and this is one of the most interesting planes they have to offer. So I simply wanted to make it seem like going to the hells would be a perfect vacation, even though no one goes on vacation there.</p>

	<p class="statement">The Nine Hells represent decadence, indulgence, and greed at its worst so I picked colors like gold, deep purple, slate grey and fiery red-orange. I combined these with white and black for text to recreate hell's thin veneer of wealth that gilds the evil within. I decided that the fonts I used outside of the base paragraph font needed to be similar to handwriting. As devils lure their victims into handwritten contracts that bind their souls to them for eternity. I also felt this vintage touch added to the DnD realm aesthetic I was aiming for. Most of the images I picked were from fifth edition DnD as that was when they expanded the most on infernal lore. However, I downloaded some digital papyrus images to used as a background for the navigation bar and the larger titles. I added a shadow with a deep orange color that looks similar to how their contracts look as well.</p>
