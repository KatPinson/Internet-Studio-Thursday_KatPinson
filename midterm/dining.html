	<p>
If you can sneak into one of Mammon's prized vineyards in Minauros beyond the rotting volcanic swamp, you can obtain some of the highest quality vintage blood apricot wines. Maybe even some cheese to pair it with. And, if you're lucky, they'll only chop your hands off if they catch you! Blood apricots are fruit born at sites of mass violence so bloody that they taint the trees around it. Naturally, devils delight in their sweet notes with a hint of iron. It's a personal favorite of Mammon, the archdevil of greed and excess.

	<p>
		For some reason, the dual archdevil rulers of Phlegethos have invited you to dine with them and their court. Devils don't even need to eat. Fierna and Belial are always stirring up trouble with each other and trying to make others join their crusade against the other.  The main course is glazed dwarf marinated in a baator whiskey rub. Oh? What's this? Mortals can't stomach baator whiskey? Then it appears the feast is your agony, human. Try not to offend them.

	<img src="/midterm/images/devils.jpg" class="devils">
	<p>
		The archdevil Dispater, Lord of Dis, has invited you to feast upon his enemies with him. What an honor. He despises other beings that aren't devils, and never invites lesser beings to his iron city. Even if you don't want to, his word is law and his suggestion spells will encourage you to eat your fill anyway. Rumor has it people have gone mad from eating devil flesh. Good luck.
