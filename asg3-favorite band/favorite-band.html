	<h1>Amigo the Devil</h1>
	<p>Amigo the Devil is a neo-folk band that features horror themes and morbid stories.</p>
	<br>
	<p> Danny Kiranos leads the band and started off as a solo act, but now performs with more members as accompaniment. 
		Personally, his songs about how he views the world make me feel very seen. There's not really a whole lot of horror-based music, 
		so it's also nice to have more representation in the genre. Seeing another person of Greek descent being unapologetically themselves 
		is also very inspiring for me. His best songs in my opinion are "Hell and You" and "One Kind of People."</p>
