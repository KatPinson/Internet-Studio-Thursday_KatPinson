    The images look clickable, but the text underneath the images does not. 
However you can still click the text and be brought to the same website part as the images.

    Stories get ourr audiences more emotionally invested in a product. We can use visceral, behavioral, and reflective design to achieve this goal. 
Visceral design is what humans gravitate naturally towards from an aesthetic perspective. Specifically symmetrical objects, attractive people and no objects
that are found universally disgusting. Behavioral design encompasses how functional, useful and stylish the product is which encourages people to buy it.
Finally, reflective design is how people reflect on their first interactions with the products. Then we can use the experience theme to tailor a story
that will hook the target audience.

    The primary ways to create emphasis through typeface are to change the style and increase the font. I personally liked the way this website did it
    as they added a fun font that emphasized the joy you get through fiber arts. (It's my favorite thing, I'm sorry you'll hear about it a lot this semester.)

<h1>Purpose:</h1>
<p>
    The purpose of my website is to bring the different types of art yarn to them. It will be its own specific site, made for spinners specifically, as some
     sites have different sections that discuss it.
</p>

<br>

<h1>Audience:</h1>

<p>
    My primary audience will be spinners, specifically intermediate to experienced spinners that want to make their own art yarn through tutorials.
    Although, the website will bring awareness to this dying craft, potentially beginners might be interested.
</p>

<br>

<h1>Competition:</h1>
<p>
    The competition would primarily be with Ravelry as it is the only website to offer spinners some form of online tutorials, but its primary use is for
    knitters and to a lesser extent crocheters. The only other competition I would have are books provided by professional spinners.
</p>

<br>

<h1>Key Messages:</h1>
<p>
    My website will make it easier to spin art yarn on a website specifically designed with spinners in mind. I fully intend to make it easy to navigate by
    yarn thickness and ply as well. Learning art yarn will be an easier craft to learn and it will inspire them to share my website with others.
</p>

<br>

<h1>Call to Action:</h1>

<p>
    This website will encourage viewers to not only spin, but also to share this resource with others.
</p>

<br>

<h1>How to Measure Success:</h1>

<p>
    How many people click on the website is a basic one. But more importantly, how many people find the different categories helpful. Not to mention,
    spinners ususally have guilds, so if my website becomes a main resource that guilds use and point to. That will be an excellent measure of success.
