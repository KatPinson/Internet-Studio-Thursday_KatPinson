	<h1>Dodgeball or Death</h1>
	<p class="text">
I basically picked the meanest people from different franchises to play in a team called "Dodgeball or Death." Basically they're big, beefy jerks. They also scheme really well and are extremely powerful, which is great. I don't know how I managed to lure these beings into playing dodgeball, let alone a cooperative sport in general. But that's for me to worry about.

<div class="Abaddon">
	<h1>Abaddon the Despoiler:</h1>
	<img src="/asg11/images/Abaddon.jpg" class="Abaddon-picture">
	<p class="text">This human is a super-soldier developed by the Imperium from <i>WarHammer 40K</i>. He is anywhere between eight to nine feet tall and can think faster and better than any regular human can. He is the warmaster of numerous legions of the chaos gods. Built in mind and body, this man will obviously be leading the team in strategy.</p>

<div class="Raphael">
	<h1>Raphael:</h1>
	<img src="/asg11/images/Raphael.jpg" class="Raphael-picture">
	<p class="text">
The son of archdevil Mephistopheles and considered a mischievous deviant, even within the nine Hells, he's a born dealmaker from <i>Baldur's Gate 3</i>. His ascended form is terrifying and twelve to thirteen feet tall. He can teleport to different planes and has other devils at his disposal. I don't think anyone will be able to hit him easily.

<div class="Alduin">
	<h1>Alduin:</h1>
	<img src="/asg11/images/Alduin.jpg" class="Alduin-picture">
	<p class="text">
Alduin is a dragon from <i>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</i>. The dragons within the game basically use words of power to shape the world around them. They can use their language to have fiery breath or literally bend people to their will. As long as Alduin points his shouts in the right direction, the enemy team will practically surrender at his command.

<div class="Mr-House">
	<h1>Mr. House:</h1>
	<img src="/asg11/images/MrHouse.jpg" class="MrHouse-picture">
	<p class="text">
Mr. Robert House, called Mr. House, from <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i> isn't technically a villain. He's considered morally grey, but I think you'd be hardpressed to find any man who builds a robot army that is a good guy. He's a self-declared autocrat(dictator) who thinks he should rule the nuclear wastes simply because he is highly intelligent. He could send one of his robots to play dodgeball. There will be casualties, but they probably won't be intentional.

<div class="The-Being">
	<h1>The Being:</h1>
	<img src="/asg11/images/TheBeing.jpg" class="TheBeing-picture">
	<p class="text">
<i>Darkwood</i> is a game where the town is slowly being devoured by The Being. It releases spores that turn people insane before corrupting their bodies to its own eldritch purposes. It surrounds itself with mind-controlled zombies to protect it from harm. The enemy team literally will have to forfeit if they don't want to be assimilated.
