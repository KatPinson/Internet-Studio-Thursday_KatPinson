<p>Structured content is small chunks of information on a subject that is versatile and easy to convey through simple coding like paragraphs or images. Whereas, semantic HTML corresponds to how the document elements relate to each other like headings and lists. It's important to utilize both when making a website because we are linking computational algorithms to aesthetic information. The design behind an object is important to communicate the message itself that we are using the website to communicate. Meanwhile, the computer needs to be able to understand and process the coders' requests through semantic elements.</p>

<p>The website that is the most similar in terms of content to what I desire for my final project is Ravelry's fiber stash section. However, it is severly lacking in terms of spinning options and filters for spinners. Primarily because it is a site made for knitters and crocheters. They have a website called Artyarns who surprisingly doesn't focus on art yarns as much as I like, but overall I like their design for a website. It's very cozy and smooth, which would appeal to my audience better. I also included another pattern website simply used for reference because it's for seamstresses.</p>

<p>To banish my inner-critic, I think the best methods are truth-seeking and delaying. Delaying my inner critic for when I actually need it would make it infinitely more useful. Then truth-seeking to see if what it has to say has any merit. I'm a very pragmatic person, so I'm only interested in something if it is useful to my creative process. Hyperbolic discounting is when you make more rational decisions as you're forced to wait longer. Generally speaking, I tend to do my work in small increments over time or make little goals for myself like the ones that school already assigns. Breaking up larger assignments into checklists makes it easier to feel productive and be productive without getting overwhelmed. For example, I did the first part of this assignment on one night, then the next two parts on another, before finishing this part. Basically I'm tricking my brain. My network-making power is that I get to pick who my websites are for and what they are for. So it's ideal for me to be as inclusive as possible if I want my messages, information, and services to meet many different types of people.</p>
