	<h1>Dream Jobs:</h1>
	<p>Truth be told, my dream career would be a part-time writer/artist. Specifically, where I am able to alternate between the two past-times that I love: making fiber art sculptures and writing fiction. But in the short-term, I need to pay my bills. So while I stockpile some money, I picked a few safe jobs until I make it big doing what I love.</p>

	<a href="https://www.indeed.com/q-national-life-l-richardson,-tx-jobs.html?vjk=85253826f4708018">National Life Group Underwriter</a>
	<p>Although people are reluctant to label our current economic status as a depression, statistics indicate it most likely is. The most secure jobs are the jobs that train you because they treat you like an investment and are more likely to keep you around after you are trained. National Life Group is an excellent choice in this regard because they keep a good portion of the employees they hire, but they also help you learn how to underwrite life insurance policies. They also have a lot of very good employee benefits.</p>

	<h2>Floral Designer Assistant</h2>
	<a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=delphinium&l=Dallas%2C+TX&from=searchOnHP&vjk=eab105244e4c0f05">Floral Designer Assistant</a>
	<p>I am pretty experienced with tending to plants and nature in general. My grandmother has the largest garden I've seen and takes excellent care of her plants since before I was born. She gave me her green thumb and I understand a lot about them. This floral designer assistant job would require a little bit of effort on my part as I would have to learn how to design flower arrangements, but you can learn that while working for them. It's also an invaluable skill that can be used anywhere you live. As I want to move out of Texas, it would benefit me greatly.</p>

		<p>This would be excellent for me as I already have extensive experience with Computer-Aided Design(CAD) and I love independent jewelry makers. CAD is used to make jewelry and determine their measurements. I think I would be perfect in this position as I would fit in with this company's aesthetic and generally love their styles. It's a small company and I genuinely like small company culture better than large coorporation office cultures. Also this is a skillset that is also transferable to many different places.</p>
