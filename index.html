    <h1>Katherine Pinson</h1>
    <p>I enjoy making weird and cool fiber art, specifically tapestries and sculptures. I also enjoy stop-motion animation and writing when I have time available during the school year.
        I specifically love weaving and hope to combine that with 3D-printing. I love old-fashioned RPG video games, tabletop RPGs and Warhammer 40K. I really just love anything with a bunch of lore
    that I can sink my teeth into. </p>
